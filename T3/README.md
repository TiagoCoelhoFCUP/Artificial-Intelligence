## Grammar Checker

In this first introductory task to the paradigm shift from an imperative to a declarative language, we develop a grammar checker using both an imperative and declarative language (java and prolog) for a very specific subset of the portuguese language, using only:
<ul> <li>Names: "cacador","cachorro","rio","mar","tempo","sino","vento","martelo","rosto","tambor","menina",
  "noticia","floresta","porta","vida","mae","cidade","lobos","tambores","meninas","lagrimas"</li>
  <li>Verbs: "corre","correu","bateu","corriam","bateram","correram"</li>
  <li>Prepositions: "para","com"</li>
  <li>Preposition Contractions: "na","pela","Na","Pela","no","pelo","No","Pelo","nos","pelos","Nos","Pelos","nas","pelas","Nas","Pelas"</li>
  <li>Determiners: "o","O","a","A","os","Os","as","As"
</ul> 

By providing a sentece from the standard input you'll get a boolean return that represent the validity of your sentence.

## Flight Planner

After this, we moved on to a second more complex task, which was to develop a flight planner also using both delarative and imperative programming languages (java and prolog).
You can execute/querie the program in one of three ways.

<ul>
  <li> Given the origin and destination it returns all the days with available flights between the provided locations </li>
  <li> Given the origin, destination and weekday it returns all routes that start in the origin and end in the destinantion location on that specific weekday </li>
  <li> Given 3 destination locations it returns the all routes that go through all of the provided locations </li>
 </ul>
